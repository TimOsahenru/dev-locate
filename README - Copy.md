## Basic setup(git, python and editor)

I assume the average user of this application has a fundamental understanding of the Python programming language,
has git running on their machine and has a desired editor (VScode or Pycharm)

if you do not have Python running on your machine you can check [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/install-python-windows-10) to 
begin with how to run and setup Python on your machine.

to begin with how to run git on your machine check [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-git-windows) for a detailed instruction
I comfortably use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) but any editor with a commandline/ terminal will do for a beginner
